InterBud
---

This is a simple chat frontend that allows a keyboard user to interact with OpenAI's GPT-4o.
GPT has command run access and can interact with files and folders under a given base folder.

To run the chat, a valid OpenAI API key with access to GPT-4o is required. Run the app like this:

./interbud --openai_api_key <api_key>

You can exit it at any time with CTRL-D.
